* Elizabot 
A toy implementation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA][ELIZA]] as a Telegram bot.

** Installation and usage

*** With quicklisp
Just clone this repo in a place quicklisp can reach then, at a repl:
#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(ql:quickload :elizabot)
(setf elizabot:*token* "my-telegram-bot-token")
(elizabot:add-translation '((?x *) "is" "a" "fool") '(?x "sure" "is"))
(elizabot:run)
#+END_SRC

The first command loads elizabot, the second one configures the bot's token. The third adds a translation rule and finally the last one starts the bot.

Now sending a message like =foo is a fool= to your bot will make it reply with =foo sure is=. Documentation about how to write rules is somewhere in the source code.

*** Without quicklisp
I don't know, use quicklisp.
